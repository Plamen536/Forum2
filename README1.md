# Forum2# Project Description

Design and implement a Forum System, where users can create posts, add comments, and upvote/downvote the things they like or dislike the most. Choose what your forum will be about and stick with it. Examples: an automotive fanbase forum, java technical learning forum, crypto trading forum, fashion forum, etc. The forum should revolve around one or two general topics.

## Functional Requirements

### Entities (documents)

- Authentication is handled by Firebase, there is no need for an auth entity.
- Each user **must** have a first and last name, email, and/or username.
  - First name and last name **must** be between 4 and 32 symbols.
  - Email **must** be a valid email and unique in the system.
- Each admin **must** have a first and last name, email, and may have a phone number.
  - First name and last name **must** be between 4 and 32 symbols.
  - Email **must** be a valid email and unique in the system.
- Each post **must** have a user who created it, a title, content, comments, and how many likes it has received.
  - The title **must** be between 16 and 64 symbols.
  - The content **must** be between 32 symbols and 8192 symbols.
  - The post **must** have a user who created it.
  - Other users **must** be able to post replies.

### Public Part

The public part **must** be accessible without authentication.

- On the home page, anonymous users **must** be presented with the core features of the platform as well as how many people are using it and how many posts have been created so far.
- Anonymous users **must** be able to register and log in.
- Anonymous users should be able to see a list of the top 10 most commented posts and a list of the 10 most recently created posts.

### Private Part

Accessible only if the user is authenticated.

- The user **must** be able to log in and log out.
- Users **must** be able to browse posts created by other users with an option to sort and filter them.
- Users **must** be able to view a single post including its title, content, comments, likes, etc. The details of the post and any available user actions (comment/like/edit) should be presented on the same page.
- Users **must** be able to update their profile information. Users should not be able to change their username once registered. Users could upload a profile photo.
- Users **must** be able to create a new post with at least a title and content.
- Each user **must** be able to edit only personal posts or comments.
- Each user **must** be able to view all their or any other user’s posts and comments (with the option to filter and sort them).
- Each user **must** be able to remove one or more of their own posts. Deleting a post should be available while reading the details of an individual post or when browsing the list of all posts.
- Each user **must** be able to comment/reply to any other forum post.

### Administrative Part

Accessible to users with administrative privileges.

- Admin **must** be able to search for a user by their username, email, or display name.
- Admin **must** be able to block or unblock individual users. A blocked user **must** not be able to create posts or comments.
- Admin **must** be able to delete any post.
- Admin **must** be able to view a list of all posts with an option to filter and sort them.

### Optional Feature

**Post Tags** – To help users navigate and find certain topics faster, you can implement tags. A tag is additional information that can be put under each post after creating the post. The process of adding a tag/s to a post is as follows: The user creates a post, then proceeds to edit the post. Once on the edit post page, the user can add a tag/s under it. If the tag does not exist, a new one **must** be added to the database. If the tag exists, a new one **must** not be created; the one already in the database **must** be reused. All tags should be lowercase only.

After the post is tagged, other users can find it by typing in the tag in the search bar. For example: if your forum is about cars, a post is marked with the tags: “mercedes” and “tuning,” when “mercedes” is typed in the search bar, all posts that are tagged with “mercedes” should appear in the front-end.

A user **must** be able to add/remove/edit tags

### Firebase Realtime Database

All data should be stored in the document (NoSQL) database hosted by Google Firebase. You must think of a way to organize your documents to achieve the functionalities described above.

## Use Cases

### Scenario 1

A friend of Pavel’s told him about this amazing forum, where lots of people share their ideas and perspectives on the crypto/stock market. Pavel enters the website and sees a feed of posts. He can sort them by most liked or newest. He can also filter them by certain words. He is an anonymous user so he cannot create a post yet. He registers and then logs in to the forum. He can now start sharing his ideas with his buddy crypto “holders.”

### Scenario 2

Your forum has accumulated thousands of new users. Most of them are proactively helpful and positive, but some of them started posting spam or irrelevant information to the forum. You hire a moderator. You instruct the moderator to enter the forum and create a first-time registration. You as an admin give admin rights to your moderator through the forum. They can now start deleting posts and ban users that do not follow the forum rules!

## Technical Requirements

### General

- Follow OOP principles when coding (if and when applicable).
- Follow KISS, SOLID, DRY principles when coding.
- Follow the functional programming principles (use pure functions, avoid side effects, make use of array methods and higher-order functions where applicable).
- Use tiered project structure (separate the application in layers).
- You should implement proper exception handling and propagation.
- Try to think ahead. When developing something, think – “How hard would it be to change/modify this later?”

### Git

Commits in the GitHub repository should give a good overview of how the project was developed, which features were created first, and the people who contributed. Contributions from all team members must be evident through the git commit history! The repository must contain the complete application source code and any scripts (database scripts, for example).

Provide a link to a GitHub repository with the following information in the README.md file:

- Project description
- Link to the hosted project (if hosted online)
- Instructions on how to set up and run the project locally.
- Scheme (structure) of the documents in the database (must)

## Instructions to Set Up and Run the Project Locally

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:

   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

4. **Open the application**:
   Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the application running.

### Optional Requirements

- Integrate your project with a Continuous Integration server and configure your unit tests to run on each commit to your master branch.
- Use branches while working with git.
- Host the entire application in Firebase (Firebase Realtime Database + Firebase Hosting).
